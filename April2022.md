  Started this training diary, began familiarizing with github. Little to no experience with git/github, need to lookup a good guide. Worked on aws course for SSA at https://cantrill.io/ Covered IAM roles, groups, and identities. Built a fake IAM org and added three (two?) accounts to the organization. Registered the buildthew.net domain using the route 53 web portal. Aiming for a test date for SAA of 4/14. Have not purchased the exam yet.
